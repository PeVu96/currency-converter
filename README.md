## Description
This is my second project - simple currency converter.

In my currency converter you have four currencies to choose from. 
- Euro (EUR)
- US dollar (USD)
- British Pound (GBP)
- Swiss Franc (CHF)

You must enter the amount in polish currency (PLN). In currency field you need to enter **number** of polish zlotys you want to exchange.

When you click the button, the amount you need will be shown... And here we are! :)
